# abnffuzzer
This is a Java [fuzz testing](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bart/fuzz/) library for implementations of ABNF rules such as IETF RFCs. You can use it to generate random inputs for test cases, which can be helpful for finding edge case defects. I wrote it primarily as a way to learn [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/). It requires Java SE 8.
