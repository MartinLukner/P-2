<p>
	Fuzz tester for Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) rules as defined in <a
		href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234" target="_" title="IETF">RFC 5234</a>.
	This library can directly parse the ABNF rules, then generate random
	output matching those rules. That output can be fed in a test framework
	such as <a target="_" href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> to search for
	defects in an application which implements the rules. The most common
	use case would be testing implementations of other IETF RFCs.
</p>
<p>This library does not support the original BNF format. However
	you can manually update the syntax to match.</p>
