	<p>
		Fuzz tester for Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) rules as defined in
		<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234" target="_" title="IETF">RFC
			5234</a>. This library can directly parse the ABNF rules, then generate
		random output matching those rules. That output can be fed in a test
		framework such as <a target="_" href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> to
		search for defects in an application which implements the rules. The
		most common use case would be testing implementations of other IETF
		RFCs.
	</p>
	<p>This library does not support the original BNF format. However
		you can manually update the syntax to match.</p>
	<p>
		In order to use the library you must first create an input file
		containing ABNF rule definitions. In most cases you can do this by
		copying and pasting rules from a larger specification document such as
		an IETF RFC. Create a
		<code>Fuzzer</code>
		object from that file, and then call one of the
		<code>generate</code>
		methods to create each test value. For example, if you want to test an
		implementation of an ABNF rule named "foo" from RFC "9999" the code
		would look something like this.</p>
	<pre>
File file = new File("rfc9999.txt");
Fuzzer fuzzer = new Fuzzer(file);
System.out.println(fuzzer.generateAscii("foo"));
