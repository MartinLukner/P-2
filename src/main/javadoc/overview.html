		tester for Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) rules as defined in <a
			href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234" target="_" title="IETF">RFC
			5234</a>. This library can directly parse the ABNF rules, then generate
		random output matching those rules. That output can be fed into test
		cases for a framework such as <a target="_" href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a>
		to search for defects in an application which implements the rules.
		The most common use case would be testing implementations of other
		IETF RFCs. Fuzz testing is useful for improving test coverage and
		catching edge case defects
	</p>
	<p>This library does not support the original BNF format. However
		you can manually update the syntax to match.</p>
	<p>
		In order to use the library you must first create an input file
		containing ABNF rule definitions. In most cases you can do this by
		copying and pasting rules from a larger specification document such as
		an IETF RFC. Create a
		<code>Fuzzer</code>
		object from that file, and then call one of the
		<code>generate</code>
		methods to create each test value. For example, if you want to test an
		implementation of an ABNF rule named "foo" from RFC "9999" the code
		would look something like this.
	</p>
	<pre>
File file = new File("rfc9999.txt");
Fuzzer fuzzer = new Fuzzer(file);
System.out.println(fuzzer.generateAscii("foo"));
		</pre>
	<p>
		This application can also be used from the command line. (You need to
		have the ANTLR <a href="http://www.antlr.org/download.html" target="_">Java
			runtime binaries jar</a> in your CLASSPATH.) For example to read ABNF
		rules defined in
		<code>rfc9999.txt</code>
		and output 10 values matching rule "foo" and encoded in the US_ASCII
		character set you could use a command like this.
	</p>
	<pre>
java -jar AbnfFuzzer-1.0.0.jar -n 10 -i rfc9999.txt foo
		</pre>
